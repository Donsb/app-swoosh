         View is the UIViewController's View.
         frame is the position and size.
         size is the size of the frame.
         .width is the width of the screen.
         The x code 1st divides by 2 to get the center of the screen (VIEW). The 2nd - the Swossh middle, to place swoosh in
         the middle.  The first line alone would only put the top/left corner of Swoosh in the middle.
         So, we place it in the middle, and then subtract the one half of swoosh so IT is in the middle.

         Make the image the exact size of the View.
